# electron-quick-start with react, typescript, css modules

**Clone and run for a quick way to see an Electron in action.**

This is an Electron application based on [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](http://electron.atom.io/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

I've added:

- `typescript, typings` - Moved to ts, then tsx files
- `React, ReactDOM` - for front end
- `D3` in charting branch

## To Use

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/happyt/electronreact
# Go into the repository
cd electronreact
# Install dependencies and run the app
npm install && npm start
```

## Next steps

- `source, dist` - Tidy up with these directories
- `add CSS modules` 
-
